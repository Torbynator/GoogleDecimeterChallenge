# Problems
## Prio 1 (until next week)
- [ ] Data feeding to neural network (changing sattelite number, unfilled data columns...)

- [ ] Visualize output

- [ ] Find alternatives to LSTM layers (recurrent neural networks)
    - [ ] Lecture
    - [ ] Assignment
    - [ ] Internet

- [ ] Implement dataloader
    - [ ] find common place on fast hard drive, where we store the big dataset (C:\MLM zB)

- [ ] Find internal submission deadline

## Prio 2 (until next few weeks)

- [ ] Easy LSTM setup + 2 dense layers

## Prio 3 (until submission (add date))

- [ ] Make presentation

- [ ] Make report

## Prio 4 (optional)
- [ ] Research transformer networks and frameworks

## solved
created coworking space with git in vs code\
installed copilot\
understood structure of data
